                <h3> WHAT IS ACUPUNCTURE? </h3>  
		        <p> Acupuncture is an Ancient Chinese Medicine that uses knowledge of body energy (Qi) flow
                    through meridians to identify blockages. I treat those blockages to restore the balance 
                    of the flow and return health to your body. </p>
                <h3> HOW DOES ACUPUNCTURE WORK? </h3>     
		        <p> Needles help to move the energy through the meridian and reconnect the energy (Qi) flow
                    through the blockages. As well, at the site of the needle, the body produces its own 
                    natural "pain killer" (a substance known as endorphins) which gives Acupuncture additional 
                    additional power for treatment of disorders with pain as a major symptom. </p>
                <h3> CAN IT BE USED WITH OTHER THERAPIES? </h3>  
		        <p>Acupuncture can be combined with the following therapies: massage, physiotherapy, chiropractic
                    homeopathic, etc. It can also be combined safely with most Western Medicine therapies. As a 
                    matter of fact, it is now used in some hospitals and dental linics for some procedures instead 
                    of traditional methods of sedating patients.</p>
                <h3> WHAT CAN ACUPUNCTURE TREAT? </h3>

                <h3> IS IT COVERED BY MY HEALTH PLAN? </h3>
		        <p>Most health plans cover "Acupuncturists" as a natural or "Other" therapy practitioner only if the
                    practitioner is registered, as I am, with CTCMPAO.</p>
