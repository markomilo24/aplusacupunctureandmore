                <h3> WHAT IS ACUPUNCTURE? </h3>  
		        <p> Homeopathy is a completely natural, wholesome, non-harmful medicine that began in Germany in
                    the 18th century and has been proven to work with no side effects on thousands of patients all
                    over the world. It is easy to take, either in drops or in pellets and it is very affordable. The
                    British Royal Family has been for many generations and continues to be one of the great supporters
                    of Homeopathy.
                </p>
                <h3> HOW DOES HOMEOPATHY WORK? </h3>     
		        <p> It can practically treat any symptom, syndrome or disease because the practitioner finds the remedy
                    that best matches with the list of symptoms and works to rebalance the body by reversing the signs 
                    and symptoms of the patient. This type of medicine works on the energetic level stimulating the body
                    to heal itself in a natural and gentle way. </p>
                <h3> HOMEOPATHY AS MEDICINE </h3>  
		        <p>I believe that homeopathic and mainstream medicine are mostly complementary and together they can
                    create a natural, gentle, patient-specific and personalized medicine.
                </p>
		        <p>Homeopathy was established by medical doctors more than 200 years ago and some of its benefits are:
