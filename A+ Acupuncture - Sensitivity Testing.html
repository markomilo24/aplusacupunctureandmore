                <h3> WHAT IS SENSITIVITY TESTING? </h3>  
		        <p> Electro-acupuncture is a legitimate, scientically indisputable measurement of skin resistance at
                    dened points. The skin resistance changes according to the patient’s condition. It is synthesis of 
                    thousand-year old Chinese medical wisdom and modern technology into very reliable evaluatory procedure
                    - Biomeridian MSAS test. We are trained to utilize this sophisticated testing method and present 
                    and explain the outcome and summary of the procedure in "easy to understand" manner for every client.
                    We measure the electrical potential of the acupuncture point with a new version of the old Vega machine
                    used in the 70’s, a computerized sensitivity testing machine called Biomeridian MSAS, that combines
                    information and knowledge of Western, Chinese and Homeopathic medicine. With the MSAS, we identify
                    nutritional and environmental sensitivities, toxicity (heavy metals, chemicals, bacteria, parasites,
                    virus, toxins, etc.) and emotional disbalances. This testing machine is an information gathering tool 
                    that demonstrates relationships between item(s) that we test and the patient’s body response to the 
                    challenge.</p>
                <h3> BIOMERIDIAN MSAS INCORPORATES: </h3>     
		        <p> 
                    <ol>
                        <li> WESTERN MEDICINE CONCEPTS: We use medical diagnosis with knowledge of the symptoms. </l1>
                        <li> TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE: We use the principle that there are always energetic changes
                             before any physical symptoms or manifestations occur. </li>
                        <li> HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE: Based on the principle of the Law of Similars “like cures like”. </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>                    
                <h3> HOW DOES SENSITIVITY TESTING WORK? </h3>     
		        <p> We take the patient’s medical history to understand symptoms in order to create specic testing protocol 
                    to individualize and accomodate the test to the needs of each patient. MSAS reads the disbalance for 
                    each organ and translates it into numbers (%). This data is used to choose the best treatment option for
                    each patient. MSAS will read the exact product that brings any “out of balance” organ or system back to 
                    balance. MSAS is an individualized form of testing that will lead us to an individualized and optimum
                    treatment for each patient.</p>
