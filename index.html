		        <p> Dubravka (Deb) Milovanovic was born in Sarajevo, former Yugoslavia where she graduated 
			    with a degree in Western Medicine and earned her degree as a Doctor of Medicine in 1985.
		 	    She worked as a Professor of Medical Subjects in three different schools (dental assistants, 
		 	    nurses and midwifes) for three years. In addition to this, she also volunteered at the Institute
		 	    for Social Medicine and nutritional hygiene with the late Dr. Svetlana Zec, the only doctor nutritionist

		        <p> In 1989, she recieved a scholarship to study Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine
			    (TCM) in Tian Jin, P.R. China. Upon returning to Yugoslavia, she worked with four professors
			    from China as a Medical Doctor and and Acupuncturist. She wrote a book on the integration
			    of  the two medicines but it was never published due to the Yugoslav Wars that broke
			    out in 1992. Deb worked in Belgrade for one year for the European Center for Peace 
			    and Development and taught Acupuncture and TCM theory to Medical Doctors. </p>
		        <p>In 1993, she immigrated to Waterloo, Ontario where she still practices Acupuncture.
			    Deb studied Homeopathic Medicine with Professor Ron Harris, the biggest name in 
			    Homeopathic Medicine in Canada. In 2010, she was trained to work with MSAS machines to 
			    test the environmental and food sensitivity causes.</p>
		        <p>In addition to Traditional Chinese Medicine and Homeopathy, Deb is a trained Auricular 
			    Medicine and Energetic Medicine practitioner since 2003. She studied in Canada under the very 
			    best in her fields of natural medicine; Dr. Michael Adams, N.D, Dr. Gueriot, Dr. Toudelier, 
			    Dr. Robert Abell, N.D, LAc, Thom Dickson, DDSND, and Dr. Nigel Plummer. While studying under 
			    these doctors, she learned how to use natural products in biotherapeutic drainage and address 
			    different medical conditions.</p>
		        <p>Deb has been registered with the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Practitioners 
			    of Ontario (CTCMPAO) since its beginning in April of 2013. She is in the process of getting her license
